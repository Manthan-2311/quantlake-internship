### Day 1 - June 16, 2025

**Environment**: Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

**What I did**:
- Created internship folder structure
- Initialized GitHub repository
- Learned Git basics (add, commit, push)
- Practiced Python basics (variables, lists, control flow)

**Challenges**:
- None so far, everything worked smoothly

**Reflection**:
- Excited to start my internship journey. Day 1 was smooth and productive!


### Day 2 - June 17, 2025

**What I learned:**
- Lists, sets, tuples, and nested dictionaries
- Writing functions like factorial and prime checker
- Using built-in modules: math, random, datetime
- Exception handling using try-except
- Solved FizzBuzz, max finder, and string reverse

**Challenges:**
- Accessing deeply nested dictionary values took a bit of thinking

**Easiest vs Hardest:**
- Easiest: FizzBuzz and reversing a string
- Hardest: Custom error handling

### Day 3 - June 18, 2025

**Dataset Used**: Iris dataset from seaborn

**What I practiced:**
- Created Series and DataFrames manually
- Loaded and explored datasets using `.info()`, `.describe()`, `.isnull()`
- Used `.loc[]`, `.iloc[]` to access rows
- Added and dropped columns
- Explored `.value_counts()`, `.unique()`, `.mean()` etc.

**What I learned:**
- Difference between Series vs DataFrame
- Filtering and sorting real-world data
- Clean way to explore a dataset using just a few Pandas methods

**Hardest Part:**
- Remembering when to use `loc[]` vs `iloc[]`
