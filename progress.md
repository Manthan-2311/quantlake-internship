### Day 2 - June 17, 2025

**What I learned:**
- Lists, sets, tuples, and nested dictionaries
- Writing functions like factorial and prime checker
- Using built-in modules: math, random, datetime
- Exception handling using try-except
- Solved FizzBuzz, max finder, and string reverse

**Challenges:**
- Accessing deeply nested dictionary values took a bit of thinking

**Easiest vs Hardest:**
